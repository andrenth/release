(** Release is a multi-process daemon library for OCaml. Its main goal is
    to ease the development of servers following the common pattern of one
    master process and one or many slave processes.

    The usual tasks involved in setting up such process scheme are handled
    by Release. These consist of turning the master process into a daemon,
    executing the slave processes, setting up inter-process communication
    channels between master and slave, dropping privileges and chroot'ing
    the slave process, etc.

    The library also provides helper sub-modules [IO], for simple and safe
    I/O operations, [IPC], for type- and thread-safe inter-process
    communication and [Socket] for miscellaneous socket-related utility
    functions.

    Release also provides some utility sub-modules: [Buffer], a module for
    buffer operations, [Bytes], for handling binary representation of integers
    stored in buffers, [Config], for parsing and validating configuration
    files, and [Util], with miscellaneous functions. Please refer to each
    sub-module's documentation for details on their interfaces.

    Release is a multi-process framework where each process handles concurrent
    operations by relying on a library that provides asynchronous computation
    capabilities. The framework provides a functor (see [Release.Make]) which
    allows the construction of a module based on any given asynchronous library
    that provides the necessary primitives. In Release, asynchronous
    computations are represented by the ['a Lwt.t] type.

(** This module provides an interface to configuration file parsing.
    Configuration files are assumed to be collections of key-value pairs
    possibly organized in sections.

    Sections are started by a section name enclosed in square brackets.
    Keys and values are separated by an equals sign, and values can be
    integers, floats, booleans, strings, regular expressions, user-defined
    keywords or lists of one of those types, as defined by the {!Value.t}
    type.

    Keys must be named starting with a letter and optionally followed by
    any character except whitespace characters, square brackets, equals
    signs or hash signs.

    Integers values are represented by sequences of digits and floats are
    represented by sequences of digits separated by a dot character.

    Strings are sequences of characters enclosed by double quotes, and
    newline characters inside strings are supported.

    Regular expressions are enclosed by forward slash characters and support
    the same constructs as the ones documented in OCaml's [Str] module, but
    the grouping constructs [(] and [)] and the alternative between
    expressions construct [|] don't need to be escaped by a backslash.
    Newlines can be inserted in regular expressions for organization purposes
    and are ignored along with any following whitespace characters.

    Keywords are any user-defined bare words. For example, one can define
    the keywords [debug], [info], [notice], [warning], [error] and [fatal]
    in order to configure log levels of an application, thus making the
    configuration cleaner by avoiding strings for these settings.

    Finally, lists are sequences of the above types enclosed by square
    brackets and separated by commas.

    In terms of code, configuration files are specified by the {!Config.spec}
    type. This is simply a list of {!Config.section}s, each containing lists
    of {!Config.key}s. Keys are defined by their name, an optional default
    value and a list of validations. If a key has no default value and is
    absent from the configuration file, an error will be generated.

    Validation are functions as defined by the {!Validation.t} type. Many
    pre-defined validations are available in the {!Validation} module.

  (** Sets up a master process with one slave.

      [slave] is a tuple whose first element contains the {!command}
      associated to the slave process and second element is a callback
      function that is called in the master process to handle IPC requests
      from the slave (see {!IPC}).

      [background] indicates whether {!daemon} will be called. Defaults to
      [true].

      [logger] provides an optional logging facility for the master process.
      Defaults to a syslog logger.

      [privileged] indicates if the master process is to be run as [root].
      Defaults to [true].

      [slave_env] controls the environment variables available to the slave
      process. If [slave_env] is [`Inherit], the slave process will inherit
      the master's full environment. Otherwise, if [slave_env] is
      [`Keep env], the slave process will only have access to the variables
      in the [env] list. Defaults to [`Keep ["OCAMLRUNPARAM"]].

      [control], if present, is a tuple containing a path to a UNIX domain
      socket that will be created for communication with external process and
      a callback function that is called when data is sent on the socket.
      Release will set up a listener thread to deal with IPC on the control
      socket and each connection will be handled by a separate thread.

      [main], if given, is a callback function that works as the main thread
      of the master process. This function receives as an argument a function
      that returns the current list of sockets that connect the master
      process to the slave processes. This is useful for broadcast-style
      communication from the master to the slaves.

      [lock_file] is the path to the lock file created by the master process.
      This file contains the PID of the master process. If the file already
      exists and contains the PID of a running process, the master will
      refuse to start. *)

   (** This function generalizes {!master_slave}, taking the same arguments,
       except for [slave], which is substituted by [slaves]. This argument is
       a list of 3-element tuples. The first element of the tuple is the
       {!command} associated to the slave executable, the second element is
       the IPC handler for that slave and the third element is the number of
       instances to be created (i.e. the number of times the appropriate
       command will be run. *)

val me : ?logger:Lwt_log.logger
      -> ?user:string
      -> main:(IPC.connection -> unit Lwt.t)
      -> unit -> unit
  (** This function is supposed to be called in the slave process.

      [logger] provides an optional logging facility for the slave process.
      Defaults to a syslog logger.

      [user], if present, indicates the name of the user the slave process
      will drop privileges to. Dropping privileges involves the following
      steps:

      + [chroot] to the users's home directory;
      + Change the current working directory to [/];
      + Call [setgroups] on the user's GID;
      + Call [setgid] and [setuid] on the user's GID and UID, respectively;
      + Check if privileges were successfully dropped.

      If [user] is not given, the slave process will run as the same user
      used to run the master process.

      [main] is a function that works as the entry point for the slave process
      code. The file descriptor given as an argument to [main] can be used by
      the slave for communication with the master. *)
